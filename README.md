# w3-modlist-changed-files

Lists script files found in both your Witcher 3 mods folder and in a text file containing a list of file paths. Useful for checking which mods from your current modlist should be updated to work on a specific version of the game.

The included filelists cover scripts from every game update since v4.01.

Only works on Linux and WSL for now (path format issue).

Thanks to [ElementaryLewis](https://github.com/ElementaryLewis) for compiling the update changelogs [here](https://github.com/ElementaryLewis/Witcher-3-Next-Gen-Changelog).
